# Trading Guide

Learn how to effectively trade options on Epicentral Labs with our comprehensive trading guide.

## Understanding Options

Options are financial derivatives that give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price.

### Call Options
- **Right to Buy**: Gives you the right to buy the underlying asset
- **Bullish Strategy**: Profits when the asset price rises above the strike price
- **Maximum Loss**: Limited to the premium paid

### Put Options
- **Right to Sell**: Gives you the right to sell the underlying asset
- **Bearish Strategy**: Profits when the asset price falls below the strike price
- **Maximum Loss**: Limited to the premium paid

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Long Call Strategy
Buy a call option when you expect the asset price to rise.

```typescript
// Example: Buy a call option
const callOption = {
  type: 'call',
  strikePrice: 100,
  expiration: '2024-12-31',
  premium: 5
};
```

### 2. Long Put Strategy
Buy a put option when you expect the asset price to fall.

### 3. Covered Call
Sell a call option on an asset you own to generate income.

### 4. Protective Put
Buy a put option to protect against downside risk.

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
Never risk more than 2-5% of your portfolio on a single trade.

### Stop Losses
Set stop losses to limit potential losses:

```typescript
// Example: Set stop loss
const stopLoss = strikePrice * 0.8; // 20% below strike
```

### Diversification
Spread your risk across different assets and timeframes.

## Advanced Strategies

### Straddle
Buy both a call and put option with the same strike price and expiration.

### Strangle
Buy a call and put option with different strike prices but same expiration.

### Iron Condor
A four-leg strategy involving buying and selling call and put spreads.
