# Risk Management

Effective risk management is crucial for successful options trading. This guide covers essential risk management strategies and tools.

## Understanding Risk

### Types of Risk

1. **Market Risk**: Risk of adverse price movements
2. **Liquidity Risk**: Risk of not being able to exit positions
3. **Volatility Risk**: Risk from unexpected volatility changes
4. **Time Decay Risk**: Risk from time value erosion
5. **Counterparty Risk**: Risk of default (minimal in decentralized systems)

### Risk Metrics

#### Delta
Measures price sensitivity to underlying asset movements.

```typescript
// Example: Calculate position delta
const positionDelta = quantity * optionDelta;
```

#### Gamma
Measures the rate of change of delta.

#### Theta
Measures time decay of option value.

#### Vega
Measures sensitivity to volatility changes.

## Position Sizing

### Rule of Thumb
Never risk more than 2-5% of your portfolio on a single trade.

```typescript
// Example: Calculate position size
const maxRisk = portfolioValue * 0.02; // 2% risk
const positionSize = maxRisk / (strikePrice - currentPrice);
```

### Kelly Criterion
Optimal position sizing based on win rate and average win/loss ratio.

```typescript
// Kelly Criterion formula
const kellyFraction = (winRate * avgWin - (1 - winRate) * avgLoss) / avgWin;
const positionSize = portfolioValue * kellyFraction;
```

## Stop Losses

### Fixed Stop Loss
Set a predetermined exit price.

```typescript
// Example: Set stop loss at 20% below entry
const stopLoss = entryPrice * 0.8;
```

### Trailing Stop Loss
Adjusts stop loss as price moves favorably.

```typescript
// Example: Trailing stop loss
const trailingStop = Math.max(currentStop, currentPrice * 0.9);
```

### Time-Based Stops
Exit positions before expiration to avoid time decay.

## Diversification

### Asset Diversification
Spread risk across different underlying assets:

- **Crypto**: BTC, ETH, SOL
- **Traditional**: SPY, QQQ, IWM
- **Commodities**: Gold, Oil, Silver

### Strategy Diversification
Use different trading strategies:

- **Directional**: Long calls/puts
- **Neutral**: Straddles, strangles
- **Income**: Covered calls, cash-secured puts

### Time Diversification
Spread trades across different expiration dates.

## Portfolio Management

### Maximum Drawdown
Set a maximum acceptable loss from peak value.

```typescript
// Example: Check if approaching max drawdown
const currentDrawdown = (peakValue - currentValue) / peakValue;
if (currentDrawdown > maxDrawdown) {
  // Reduce position sizes or stop trading
}
```

### Correlation Analysis
Monitor correlations between positions to avoid concentration risk.

### Rebalancing
Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain target allocations.

## Risk Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
Use our platform's risk dashboard to monitor:

- **Portfolio Value**: Current total value
- **Unrealized P&L**: Current profit/loss
- **Risk Metrics**: Delta, gamma, theta, vega
- **Margin Requirements**: Required collateral

### Alerts
Set up alerts for:

- **Large Losses**: Alert when loss exceeds threshold
- **High Volatility**: Alert when volatility spikes
- **Expiration**: Alert before options expire
- **Margin Calls**: Alert when margin is low

## Stress Testing

### Scenario Analysis
Test your portfolio against various market scenarios:

- **Market Crash**: -20% to -50% moves
- **Volatility Spike**: 2x to 5x normal volatility
- **Liquidity Crisis**: Reduced market liquidity

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Run thousands of simulations to understand potential outcomes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
Begin with small position sizes while learning.

### 2. Keep Records
Maintain detailed trading logs:

```typescript
// Example: Trading log entry
const tradeLog = {
  date: new Date(),
  option: 'SOL-CALL-100',
  quantity: 1,
  entryPrice: 5.25,
  exitPrice: 6.50,
  pnl: 1.25,
  notes: 'Successful trade on SOL breakout'
};
```

### 3. Regular Review
Weekly/monthly portfolio reviews to assess performance.

### 4. Continuous Education
Stay updated on market conditions and new strategies.

### 5. Emotional Control
Avoid emotional trading decisions.

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

### 1. Over-Leveraging
Using too much leverage relative to capital.

### 2. Ignoring Correlation
Not considering how positions move together.

### 3. Chasing Losses
Increasing position sizes after losses.

### 4. FOMO Trading
Making trades out of fear of missing out.

### 5. Neglecting Time Decay
Holding positions too close to expiration.

## Tools and Resources

### Risk Calculators
Use our built-in risk calculators for:

- **Position Sizing**: Calculate optimal position sizes
- **P&L Projection**: Project potential profits/losses
- **Greeks Analysis**: Analyze option sensitivities

### Educational Resources
- **Webinars**: Regular risk management webinars
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step risk management guides
- **Community**: Learn from other traders

Remember: Risk management is not about avoiding risk entirely, but about managing it effectively to achieve your trading goals while protecting your capital.
