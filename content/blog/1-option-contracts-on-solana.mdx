# The Solana Options Standard

On **November 11th, 2024**, **@EpicentralLabs** officially announced the start of its ambitious journey to create the first **Option Standard on Solana** — making it easier for developers and protocols to introduce options trading into their DeFi platforms.

The **Solana Options Standard** will be an **open-source SDK** for developers to create **American** and **European-style Options**, with room for future **exotic options** as well.

> “Options are one of the most popular financial derivatives, making up roughly 40% of market trading volume as of September 2023 in U.S. stock markets.”  
> — *[NYSE: Trends in Options Trading (2023)](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/Trends_in_Options_Trading.pdf)*

Option contracts (similar to FX structures) can provide exceptional diversity to an investor’s portfolio — and soon, to crypto traders on Solana as well.

## The Current State of Options on Solana

Unfortunately, **options don’t really exist on Solana** in the same way they do in traditional markets.  
There are only a handful of functioning protocols with the concept of decentralized options.

A notable example is **[@DualFinance](https://twitter.com/DualFinance)**, who pioneered **Liquidity Staking Options (LSOs)** — though LSOs primarily focus on adjusting staking incentives across Solana rather than providing generalized derivatives infrastructure.

Today, most liquid and tradable option chains still exist on **centralized exchanges**, requiring:
- Proprietary market data  
- Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification  
- Compliance with jurisdictional restrictions  

The result: limited access, low composability, and no real “standard” for decentralized options.

## DeFi & Derivatives on Solana

Since 2020, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has grown massively.  
From early borrowing/lending protocols like **[@savefinance_](https://twitter.com/savefinance_)** (formerly Solend) and **[@marginfi](https://twitter.com/marginfi)**, to experimental meme-coin platforms like **[@pumpdotfun](https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun)** — Solana’s low fees and lightning speed have created a playground for builders.

Yet, across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the most common financial products are:

- **Spot Trading**  
- **Perpetuals / Leverage Trading**  
- **Outcome / Betting Markets**

To stand out, some DEXs pair with lending pools to generate yield for LPs — such as **[@JupiterExchange](https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange)** and its **JLP tokens**.  
Still, there remains *little diversity* in derivative products on Solana.

## Closing the Competitive Gap

> “Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.”  
> — *Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana Foundation (2021)*  
> [Source: Solana Foundation Blog](https://solana.com/news/anatoly-yakovenko-solana-speed-of-light)

A standardized SDK for how options are **created, executed, assigned, and exercised** removes the friction of building custom option logic for every SPL token — and ensures strong **security guarantees** through audited smart contracts.

---

## Security First

Solana’s on-chain programs can deterministically process option lifecycle events like creation, exercise, and settlement.  
By anchoring these functions on-chain, **transparency replaces trust**, and every transaction can be **verified publicly**.

Once the Option Standard SDK reaches completion, **each line of code will be audited** to uphold Solana’s reputation for safety and performance.

---

## Open Source, No Gatekeeping

There’s no reason for this to remain private.  
Epicentral Labs is **open-sourcing** the Solana Options Standard to empower developers and protocols alike.

Epicentral’s goal isn’t profit — it’s **ecosystem growth**.  
By making this SDK accessible to everyone, the DAO aims to:
- Facilitate conversations and strategies around options  
- Educate developers and traders  
- Incubate startup projects within the **EpicentralDAO**  

> “Providing value to the Solana ecosystem while staying authentic.” — *Epicentral Labs*

## What’s Next

Throughout **Q4 2024**, Epicentral Labs is building and testing the SDK toward a **beta launch in Q1 2025**.  
The DAO will integrate with existing DeFi protocols to **avoid reinventing the wheel**, leveraging best-in-class infrastructure and liquidity primitives.
